# Group 5: RAG & Generative AI (Advanced AI Agent) 

Project Title: "Beyond Chatbots: Building a Generative AI Agent for Proactive Decision Support"

Abstract:  
This group will create an advanced AI agent based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and generative AI. The AI agent will assist users not only with queries but will also proactively help generate new KPIs, dashboards, and reports based on real-time data and system context.

Goals:
- Develop a generative AI agent using RAG for enhanced decision support.
- Enable the agent to assist in generating KPIs, dashboards, and reports based on user inputs and real-time data.
